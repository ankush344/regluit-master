        <b>What if you could</b> give a book to everyone on earth?  Get an ebook and read it on any device, in any format, forever? Give an ebook to your library, for them to share?  Own DRM-free ebooks, legally?  Read free ebooks, and know their creators had been fairly paid?
    </p>
    <p>
        At Unglue.it, you can reward creators that have set their books free, via <a href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> licenses. You can buy books that WANT to be free, but need funding to get there. You can pledge toward creating free ebooks from print books.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditionally published books are stuck: legal restrictions keep you from being able to enjoy and share them. Unglue.it gets them unstuck.  Authors and publishers decide what amount lets them freely share their books with the world while still making a living.  We raise that fee here through crowdfunding: people like you chipping in.  When campaigns succeed, authors and publishers get paid, and you get a free ebook.
