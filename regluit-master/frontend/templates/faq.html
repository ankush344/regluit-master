<h4>About Unglue.it</h4>
<dl>
<dt>What is Unglue.it?</dt>

<dd><a href="/">Unglue.it</a> is a place for individuals and institutions to join together in support of free  ebooks.  We work together to support authors, publishers, or other rights holders who want their ebooks to be free.  We work together to provide durable and effective distribution for ebooks that are free. We support <a href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> licensing as an enabling tool to "unglue" the ebooks. We are part of the <a href="https://ebookfoundation.org">Free Ebook Foundation</a>, a non-profit charitable organization.</dd>

<dt>Why are all these ebooks free?</dt>

<dd>The ebooks available on Unglue.it have missions to accomplish. There are textbooks to help you learn. There is literature to open up your mind. There are books on technology to help you create. There are academic books that are spreading ideas. There are books that want to change your mind. And there are books that belong to all of us, that want to live into the future.<br /><br />

Freedom can help a book accomplish its mission, and that why the ebook is free. We call these books "unglued" and we call the process of making them free, "ungluing".</dd>


<dt>So how do you make money?</dt>

<dd>We don't - we're an non-profit. If you like what we do, <a href="{% url 'newdonation' %}">you can donate!</a></dd>

<dt>What about the authors and publishers, how do they make money?</dt>


<dd>That's the million dollar question. You don't make money by giving away ebooks. Many authors make money other ways - by teaching, by consulting, by getting tenure. Some authors do well be selling printed books alongside their free ebooks. We started Unglue.it because we hoped to give ebook creators additional ways to support their work: <a href="{% url 'faq_location' 'campaigns' %}">Ungluing Campaigns</a>.
<br /><br />  We hope you'll choose to support some of these Campaigns, but if you like an ebook you find on Unglue.it, don't hesitate to lend  your support in other ways.
</dd>

<dt>Who can use Unglue.it?</dt>

<dd>Anyone!  We're located in the United States, but we welcome participants from all over the world.<br /><br />

To fund a campaign, or buy an ebook, you'll need a valid credit card.  To use our fund raising tools for your books,  you'll need to establish yourself with us as a <a href="{% url 'rightsholders' %}">rights holder</a>.  </dd>

<dt>What do I get when I help unglue a book?</dt>
<dd>You get a better ebook.  Your unglued ebook has no restrictive DRM: you can put it on any device you want, in any format you want.   You can read it on the network or off, with no one tracking your reading.<br /><br />
You may get premiums as part of a Pledge Campaign, depending on the amount you pledge.  </dd>

<dt>Does Unglue.it own the copyright of unglued books?</dt>

<dd>No.  Books available on unglue.it are licensed by the the copyright owner.  <a href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> licenses are licensing agreements.  They grant certain rights but do not affect the status of the copyright. You can read more about these licenses at the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions">Creative Commons FAQ</a>.</dd>

<dt>If I'm a rights holder and unglue my book, can I still offer it for sale?</dt>

<dd>Yes. You are free to enter into additional licensing agreements for the work and its derivatives, including translation and film adaptations.  You may continue to sell both print and ebook editions.  Unglued ebooks can be free samples to market you and your work -- for instance, later works in the same series.  
</dd>

<dt>Does Unglue.it publish books?  Can I self-publish here?</dt>

<dd>Unglue.it is a distributor, not a publisher. If you self-publish and want your books to be free, Unglue.it can help you distribute your ebooks. </dd>

<dt>What's a rights holder?  How can I tell if I'm one?</dt>

<dd>A rights holder is a person (or entity) that has a right to copy, distribute, or sell a book in some way.  There may be one entity with all the rights to a work, or the rights may be split up among different entities: for example, one who publishes the print edition in the United States, another who publishes the print edition in the EU, another who holds electronic rights, et cetera.  For ungluing purposes, the rights holder is the entity who has uncontested worldwide commercial rights to a work.<br /><br />
If you have written a book and not signed any contracts about it, you hold all the rights.  If you have signed a contract with a publisher to produce, distribute, publish, or sell your work in a particular format or a particular territory, whether or not you still hold rights depends on the language of that contract.  We encourage you to check your contracts.  It may be in your interest to explore launching an Unglue.it campaign jointly with your publisher.<br /><br />
If you haven't written a book but you have had business or family relationships with someone who has, it's possible that you are a rights holder (for instance, you may have inherited rights from the author's estate, or your company may have acquired them during a merger).  Again, this all depends on the specific language of your contracts.  We encourage you to read them closely.  Unglue.it cannot provide legal advice.<br /><br />
If you believe you are a rights holder and would like us to help unglue your works, get started at <a href="{% url 'rightsholders' %}">the right holder tools page</a>.</dd>

<h3>Campaigns</h3>
<dl>
<dt>What are Ungluing Campaigns?</dt>

<dd>Unglue.it has three programs that support ebook creators: Pledge Campaigns, Buy-to-Unglue Campaigns and Thanks-for-Ungluing Campaigns.
<ul class="bullets">
<li> In a <i><a href="{% url 'faq_sublocation' 'campaigns' 'supporting' %}">Pledge Campaign</a></i>, book lovers pledge their support for ungluing a book. If enough support is found to reach the goal (and only then), the supporter's credit cards are charged, and an unglued ebook is released.</li>
<li> In a <i><a href="{% url 'faq_sublocation' 'campaigns' 'b2u' %}">Buy-to-Unglue Campaign</a></i>, every ebook copy sold moves the book's ungluing date closer to the present. And you can donate ebooks to your local library- that's something you can't do in the Kindle or Apple Stores!</li>
<li> In a <i><a href="{% url 'faq_sublocation' 'campaigns' 't4u' %}">Thanks-for-Ungluing Campaign</a></i>, the ebook is already released with a Creative Commons license. Supporters can express their thanks by paying what they wish for the license and the ebook.</li>

<h4>Pledge Campaigns</h4>
<div class="faq_tldr">
Support the books you've loved and make them free to everyone.
</div>
<dl>
<dt>How does this work?</dt>

<dd>Pledge Campaigns are aimed at books that have already been published and have been read - and loved - by many. At some point they stop selling, except in used bookstores where the creators don't make a dime. A pledge campaign asks those who love the book to pledge their support together with other ungluers to buy out enough rights to make the ebook free. Think of it as a way to make the public domain happen sooner.</dd>

<dt>What the book I love doesn't have a campaign?</dt>

<dd>To show the creators of a book that there are people willing to support it, just "Fave" the book. If enough people show their support in this way, the creators will take notice. They may even offer "<a href="{% url 'faq_sublocation' 'campaigns' 'premiums' %}">premiums</a>" to encourage you to pledge!</dd>

<dt>How do I pledge?</dt>

<dd>When the creators of a book have been persuaded to launch a campaign, there will be a "Support" button on the book's unglue.it page.  You'll be asked to select your premium and specify your pledge amount; choose how you'd like to be acknowledged, if your pledge is $25 or more; and enter your credit card information. If tax deductions are important to you, consider donating instead.</dd>

<dt>How do I support a campaign with a donation?</dt>

<dd>Campaigns that meet the Free Ebook Foundation's guidelines for charitable support are eligible for support via donations to the Foundation. Essentially, the Foundation will pledge to the campaign based on your direction. </dd>

<dt>When will I be charged?</dt>

<dd>For pledges, your account will be charged by the end of the next business day after a Pledge Campaign succeeds.  If a campaign doesn't succeed, you won't be charged. For donations, your account will be charged immediately. If a campaign doesn't succeed, the Foundation will use your donation in support of other ebooks.</dd>

<dt>What if I want to change or cancel a pledge?</dt>

<dd>You can modify your pledge by going to the book's page and clicking on the "Modify Pledge" button.  (The "Support" button you clicked on to make a pledge is replaced by the "Modify Pledge" button after you pledge.) You can't modify a donation, but you can make another.</dd>

<dt>How will I be recognized for my support?</dt>

<dd>Pledgers and donors are indicated on the book's page.  In addition, when ungluing campaigns are successful, you'll be acknowledged in the unglued ebook as follows:<br />
<ul class="terms">
<li>$25+ // Your name under "supporters" in the acknowledgements section.</li>
<li>$50+ // Your name and link to your profile page under "benefactors"</li>
<li>$100+ // Your name, link, and a dedication of your choice (140 characters max) under "bibliophiles"</li>
</ul>

<dt>Can people contribute anonymously?</dt>

<dd>Yes.  Anonymous donors are included in the total count of supporters, but their names and links are not included in the acknowledgements.</dd>

<dt>Is my contribution tax deductible?</dt>

<dd>Donations to the Free Ebook Foundation are tax-deductible. Pledges to campaigns might be tax-deductible if the recipient of funds is a charity, otherwise probably not. Consult your tax advisor.  </dd>
</dl>
{% endif %}
{% if sublocation == 'premiums' or sublocation == 'all' %}
<h4>Premiums</h4>
<dl>
<dt>What are premiums?</dt>

<dd>Premiums are bonuses people get for supporting a successful Pledge Campaign, to thank them and incentivize them to pledge.  If you've ever gotten a tote bag from NPR, you know what we're talking about.</dd>

<dt>Are premiums required?</dt>

<dd>No, but they're strongly encouraged for Pledge Campaigns. They are not available for Buy-to-Unglue Campaigns.</dd>

<dt>Who creates the premiums for each campaign?</dt>

<dd>The campaign manager (typically the author or publisher of the book).</dd>

<dt>Is there a minimum or maximum for how much a premium can cost?</dt>

<dd>There's a $1 minimum and a $2000 maximum.</dd>

<dt>Do I get a premium for a donation?</dt>

<dd>No, just the good feeling you get for doing your part.</dd>

<h4>General Questions</h4>
<dl>
<dt>So what is an unglued ebook?</dt>

<dd>
An unglued ebook is a <i>free</i> ebook, not an ebook that you <i>don't pay for</i>!
<br /><br />

Unglued ebooks use a <a href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> or other free license to counteract the stucked-ness of "all rights reserved" copyrights. Sometimes,  payments are made to the author, publisher, or other rights holder to facilitate the ungluing.<br /><br />

What does this mean for you?  If you're a book lover, you can read unglued ebooks for free, on the device of your choice, in the format of your choice, and share them with all your friends.  If you're a library, you can lend them to your patrons with no checkout limits or simultaneous user restrictions, and preserve them however you think best.  If you're a rights holder, you retain copyright in your work.
</dd>

</dl>
{% endif %}
{% if sublocation == 'using' or sublocation == 'all' %}
<h4>Using Your Unglued Ebook</h4>
<dl>
<dt>What can I do, legally, with an unglued ebook?  What can I <I>not</I> do?</dt>

<dd>All unglued ebooks are released under a Creative Commons or other free license.   The rights holder chooses which  license to apply. Books that we distribute in a Buy-to-Unglue Campaign  have creative commons licenses, but the effective date of these licenses is set in the future.<br /><br />

Creative Commons licenses mean that once the license is effective you <b>can</b>: make copies; keep them for as long as you like; shift them to other formats (like .mobi or PDF); share them with friends or on the internet; download them for free.<br /><br />

Under NC (non-commercial) licenses, you <b>cannot</b>: sell unglued ebooks, or otherwise use them commercially, without permission from the rights holder.<br /><br />

Under ND (no derivatives) licenses, you <b>cannot</b>:  make derivative works, such as translations or movies, without permission from the rights holder; <br /><br />

Under all CC licenses (except CC0), you <b>cannot</b>:  remove the author's name from the book, or otherwise pass it off as someone else's work; or remove or change the CC license.</dd>

<dt>Are the unglued ebooks compatible with my device?  Do I need to own an ereader, like a Kindle or a Nook, to read them?</dt>
 
<dd>Unglued ebooks are distributed with NO RESTRICTIVE DRM, so they'll work on Kindle, iPad, Kobo, Nook, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux... you get the idea.  Whether you have an ereader, a tablet, a desktop or laptop computer, or a smartphone, there are reading apps that work for you.  </dd>

<dt>Do I need to have a library card to read an unglued ebook?</dt>

<dd>No. (Though we hope you have a library card anyway!)  <br /><br />If your library has bought an ebook as part of a Buy-to-Unglue Campaign, you may need your library card if you want to borrow them. </dd>

<dt>How long do I have to read my "buy-to-unglue" ebook?  When does it expire?</dt>

<dd>If you're reading a "buy-to-unglue" book purchased  by a library, your borrowing license expires after 2 weeks. But otherwise there's no expiration. And you delete the file on the honor system.<br /><br />
If you're reading a "buy-to-unglue" book you've purchased , you may keep it as long as you like.  There's no need to return it, and it won't stop working after some deadline.  You own it.<br /><br />
If you're reading a book that's been unglued, you can keep the file forever AND you can make copies for friends.</dd>

<dt>Can I download ebooks directly from Unglue.it?</dt>

<dd>If you've purchased an ebook from unglue.it, you'll by able to download it through the website. All formats are included (where available), and you can download the ebooks for your personal use as many times as you need to.<br /><br />

Unglue.it  provides links to download thousands of previously unglued books, creative commons licensed books, and public domain ebooks.  You don't need our permission to host these free ebooks on your own site, but you must abide by the book's license terms</dd>
</dl>
{% endif %}
{% if sublocation == 'copyright' or sublocation == 'all' %}
<h4>Ungluing and Copyright</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Are Unglued Ebooks in the Public Domain?</dt>

<dd>No. Books in the public domain, because their copyrights have expired, or because they were created by the US government,  are already free for you to copy, remix, and share!  If a book is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a>, it doesn't need to be unglued, it's already unglued. But lots of other books are free-licensed even though their copyrights are still in force; if you don't adhere to the license terms, you are infringing that copyright.</dd>

<dt>How can I tell if a book is in copyright or not?</dt>

<dd>Unfortunately, it can be complicated -- which is why Unglue.it wants to simplify things, by making unglued ebooks unambiguously legal to use in certain ways.  The laws governing copyright and the public domain vary by country, so a book can be copyrighted in one place and not in another.  In the United States, the <a href="http://www.librarycopyright.net/digitalslider/">Library Copyright Slider</a> gives a quick estimate. <br /><br />

<dt>Unglue.it lists a book that I know is already Creative Commons licensed or available in the public domain. How can I get the link included?</dt>

<dd>If you are logged in to Unglue.it, the "More..." tab for every work lists the edition we know about. There is a link for every edition that you can use to tell us about Creative Commons or public domain downloads.  We require that these books be hosted at certain known, reputable repositories such as Internet Archive, Wikisources, Hathi Trust, Project Gutenberg, Github or Google Books.</dd></dl>

<h3>For Rights Holders</h3>
{% if sublocation == 'authorization' or sublocation == 'all' %}
<h4>Becoming Authorized</h4>
<dl>
<dt>What do I need to do to become a Rights Holder on Unglue.it?</dt>

<dd>To start a campaign, you need to be a verified rights holder who has signed a Rights Holder Agreement with us.  <br /><br />

Start by visiting the <a href="{% url 'rightsholders' %}">Rights Holders Tools</a> page.You'll sign  our <a href="{% url 'agree' %}">Rights Holder Agreement (RHA)</a> and learn about our various programs.</dd>

<dt>I haven't signed an agreement, but my books are listed on Unglue.it. What's going on?</dt>
<dd>If your book is listed on Unglue.it, it's either because an unglue.it user has indicated some interested in the book, or it's because we've determined that your book is already available with a free license. 
</dd>

<dt>Can I run more than one campaign?</dt>
<dd>You can run campaigns for as many, or as few, titles at a time as you like.  </dd>
</dl>
{% endif %}
{% if sublocation == 'claiming' or sublocation == 'all' %}
<h4>Claiming Works</h4>
<dl>

<dt>How can I claim a work for which I am a rights holder?</dt>

<dd>On every book page there is a More... tab.  If you have a signed Rights Holder Agreement on file, one of the options on the More... tab will be "Claim This Work".  If you represent more than one rights holder, choose the correct one for this work and click "Claim".
<br /><br />If the book is not already in Unglue.it or in Google Books, you'll need to enter the metatadata for the book by hand or work with us to load the data from a spreadsheet or Onix file.

	<ul class="bullets">
	    <li>Use <a href="{% url 'new_edition' '' '' %}">this form</a> to enter the metadata.</li>
	    <li>Your metadata should have title, identifiers, authors, language, description.</li>
	    <li>If you have a lot of books to enter, <a href="{% url 'feedback' %}?page={{request.build_absolute_uri|urlencode:""}}">contact us</a> to load ONIX or CSV files for you.</li>
	</ul>
<br /><br />If you expect to see a "Claim" button and do not, either we do not have a RHA from you yet, or we have not yet verified and filed it.  Please contact us at <a href="mailto:rights@ebookfoundation.org">rights@ebookfoundation.org</a>.</dd>

<dt>Where can I find a campaign page?</dt>

<dd>If you're looking for a specific book, search for it.  The book's page becomes a campaign page when its campaign starts.  Your bookmarks and widgets for that book will still work.<br /><br />
If you want to find an interesting campaign and don't have a specific book in mind, see the Explore sidebar (on almost any page except the FAQs) for some of our favorites.</dd>

</dl>
{% endif %}
{% if sublocation == 'campaigns' or sublocation == 'all' %}
<h4>Running Campaigns</h4>
<dl>
<dt>What do I need to create a campaign?</dt>

<dd>First, you need to be an authorized rights holder. To get authorized, <a href="{% url 'agree' %}">sign a Rights Holder Agreement</a>.  Please contact <a href="mailto:rights@ebookfoundation.org">rights@ebookfoundation.org</a> if you have any questions.  Once we have approved your Agreement, you'll be able to claim works and you'll have access to tools for launching and monitoring campaigns.  
</dd>

<dt>Can I raise any amount of money I want?</dt>

<dd>You can set any goal that you want in a Campaign. But don't be ridiculous!  Unglue.it cannot guarantee that a goal will be reached. Also, Campaigns with excessive goals will not be eligible for support via donations.</dd>

<dt>What should I include in my campaign page?</dt>

<dd>Show the world why we should love your book.  What makes it powerful, intriguing, moving, thought-provoking, important?  How does it capture readers' imaginations, engage their minds, or connect to their emotions?  Remind readers who loved the book why they loved it, and give people who haven't read it reasons they want to.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Pledge Campaigns</h4>
<dl>

<dt>What should I offer as premiums for a Pledge Campaign?</dt>

<dd>Anything you think will get ungluers excited about supporting your work.  Think about things that uniquely represent yourself or the work, that are appealing, and that you can deliver quickly and within your budget. For example, authors could consider offering Skype sessions as premiums for libraries or schools that might want to plan an event around the unglued book.  And, of course, physical or digital editions of your other books are always popular.</dd>

<dt>What can be offered as a premium?  What items are prohibited as premiums?</dt>

<dd>You can offer anything you are capable of delivering, so long as it is not illegal or otherwise restricted in the United States.  For instance, your premiums may not include alcohol, drugs, or firearms.  For full details, consult our <a href="/terms/">Terms of Use</a>.</dd>

<dt id='donation_support'>Is my campaign eligible for charitable donation support?</dt>

<dd>
The Free Ebook Foundation may provide support for some campaigns using donations. These campaigns are subject to the following guidelines:
<ol>
<li>Proceeds of a campaign must not benefit a candidate for political office and books to be unglued shall not be primarily aimed at influencing legislation.</li>
<li>Proceeds of a campaign must not benefit organizations or individuals subject to regulation by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.</li>
<li>Books to be unglued with Foundation support should clearly benefit the public at large  - by advancing scholarship and learning, spreading scientific knowledge, achieving artistic, literary or cultural goals, educating students, promoting literacy and reading, documenting history, meeting the needs of underserved communities, raising awareness and understanding of the world around us. </li>
<li>The amount of support requested should be limited to the reasonable costs of producing the book and procuring associated rights. When a campaign is offered using a license with a “non-commercial” restriction, it is expected that the rights holders will bear part of these expenses themselves. When the campaign beneficiary is not a US-based non-profit, documentation of expenses may be requested.</li>
</ol>


</dd>

<dt>Who is responsible for making sure a rights holder delivers premiums?</dt>

<dd>The rights holder.</dd>

<dt>How can I get my supporters' information (mailing address, T-shirt size, etc.) to fulfill premiums?</dt>

<dd>Unglue.it will share supporters' emails and the premiums they are owed with rights holders if, and only if, a campaign succeeds.  Campaign managers can also message supporters via the website. If you need additional information to fulfill premiums, you may email ungluers directly.  Rights holders are required to comply with the Unglue.it privacy policy.</dd>


<dt>How can supporters contact me?</dt>

<dd>If you'd like supporters to contact you directly, please set your contact email address in the campaign management area. </dd>

<dt>What is my responsibility for answering questions from supporters and non-supporters?</dt>

<dd>It's up to you.  However, our experience watching and running crowdfunding campaigns suggests that you'll do best if you're engaged, prompt, and personable.  In fact, don't just think in terms of answering questions (though you should absolutely do that) -- think about cultivating and contributing to the conversation.</dd>

<h4>Publicizing Campaigns</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Can I contact my supporters directly?</dt>
<dd>Yes, when you're logged in as a campaign manager, you can contact supporters directly via the ungluers tab. You can also enter comments which are delivered to every supporter who hasn't opted out of comments.<br /><br />
 We don't get other contact information, except as needed to fulfill premiums after successful campaigns.  Supporters may voluntarily disclose certain contact information (such as Twitter handles) on their profile pages.  We encourage you to be thoughtful in your use of this information.  </dd>

<dt>How do I get feedback from supporters or fans about my campaign?</dt>

<dd>Ask them!<br /><br />

Also, pay attention to places they're talking about your campaign.  This might be the Comments tab, a hashtag on Twitter, the comments section of your blog, a forum on your web site, your Facebook page, et cetera.  You can use your campaign pitch to point them to these spaces, too.  Read them regularly to see what people are saying, and to participate in the conversation.</dd>

<dt>How do I share my campaign?</dt>

<dd>On every campaign page, you can generate an HTML widget that you can embed wherever you like.  It will automatically be updated with your campaign's progress.  There are also links to share the page via email and social networks. <br /><br />

Have other ways you want to share?  Your own blog, newsletter, or social media presence?  Your friends, and their friends?  Professional associations?  Media contacts?  Go for it!<br /><br />

Need more ideas?  We're happy to work with rights holders personally to craft a campaign strategy.</dd>

<dt>How can I get my campaign featured on the home page or the Explore menu pages?</dt>

<dd>We automatically generate those lists from the books with the most (or most recent) wishes, pledges, and comments.  The more people you can rally to show their love of your book, the more likely it is to be featured there.</dd>

<h4>Ebook Conversion</h4>
<dl>
<dt>I am a copyright holder. Do I need to already have a digital file for a book I want to unglue?</dt>

<dd>For a Buy-to-Unglue Campaign, yes, you'll need to upload an EPUB file for each book. For Pledge Campaigns, no, you may run campaigns for books that exist only in print copies or are out of print.  Any print book can be scanned to create a digital file that can then become an EPUB-format unglued ebook. For Thanks-for-Ungluing campaigns, you can use EPUB, MOBI, pdf and html files.</dd>

<dt>Will Unglue.it scan books and produce EPUB files?</dt>

<dd>No. We can help you find third parties who will contract for conversion services.</dd>

<dt>Will Unglue.it raise money to help pay for conversion costs?</dt>

<dd>A Pledge campaign target should include conversion costs. For a Buy-to-Unglue and Thanks-for-Ungluing campaigns, you'll need to have pre-existing files.</dd>

<dt>What are the requirements for my ebook files?</dt>

<dd>
{% include 'ebookfiles.html' %}
</dd>

</dl>
{% endif %}
{% if sublocation == 'funding' or sublocation == 'all' %}
<h4>Funding</h4>
<dl>
<dt>What parameters are required for a campaign? </dt>
<dd>For a Pledge Campaign, you'll need to set funding goal and deadline. For a Buy-to-Unglue Campaign, you'll need a revenue goal and an initial effective date for the Creative Commons License. You'll also need to set prices for each type of license you plan to offer. For a Thanks-for-Ingluing campaign, you just need to decide on a suggested contribution.</dd>

<dt>Can I change my funding/revenue goal?</dt>
<dd>While a campaign is in progress you may lower, but not raise, your funding or revenue goal.</dd>

<dt>Can I change my deadline in a Pledge Campaign?</dt>
<dd>No.</dd>

<dt>Can I change the price for an ebook I'm offering for purchase?</dt>
<dd>Yes!</dd>

<dt>Are contributions refundable?</dt>

<dd>Unglue.it contributions are non-refundable. Once a campaign succeeds, supporters' credit cards will be charged the full amount of their pledge.  However, they will not be charged until, and unless, the campaign succeeds.  Before that time they may modify or cancel their pledges without charge. Buy-to-Unglue license purchases are not returnable or refundable by Unglue.it, but rights holders need to keep customers happy with respect to the products they buy, as customers are free to post comments on the work page. Donations are not refundable.
</dd>

<dt>What if an ungluer contests a charge?</dt>

<dd>Ungluers may contest charges, either with the payment processor or with their credit card issuer.  Unglue.it is not liable for this and rights holders are liable for any pledge chargebacks.  We encourage rights holders to provide clear, timely communication to their supporters throughout the campaign to ensure they remember what they pledged to and why.</dd>

<dt>What happens if a supporter's credit card is declined?</dt>

<dd>Although credit cards are authorized at the time of pledging, a small percentage of cards will get voided between the time of authorization and the time the credit card is actually charged. Rights holders are responsible for any funding shortfall due to voided credit cards.</dd>

<dt>What happens if a buyer wants a refund?</dt>

<dd>Our policy is for 100% supporter satisfaction. We may hold back a 30% reserve for 90 days to cover possible customer refunds.</dd>

<dt>Can I offer tax deductions to people who pledge to my campaign?</dt>

<dd>If you are a 501(c)3 or similar, please consult your own attorneys and accountants about the tax deductibility of ungluers' pledged.  Donations to the Free Ebook Foundation are tax deductible in the USA; rights holders are not involved. </dd>

<dt>How do I know when I have started fundraising?</dt>

<dd>Unglue.it will be in communication with you about when campaigns should go live.  On your <a href="{% url 'rightsholders' %}">rights holder tools page</a>, you will be able to see all works you have claimed and the status of any associated campaigns.</dd>

<dt>When and how will I be paid?</dt>

<dd><ul><li>For <i>Pledge Campaigns</i>: After we reach the threshold price Unglue.it will issue you a closing memo, which will cover your gross and net proceeds.  Unglue.it will hold the proceeds until you deliver an EPUB file meeting Unglue.it's quality standards, at which point Unglue.it will send you a check.  If Unglue.it does not receive a suitable EPUB file within 90 days, we will deduct conversion costs from your funds and release the rest to you.</li>
<li>For <i>Buy-to-Unglue Campaigns</i> and <i>Thanks-for-Ungluing Campaigns</i>: We make payments quarterly to rights holders who have accrued more than $100 in earnings. If we are able to set you up with ACH transfers, we will  send payments more frequently. 70% of earnings accrue immediately; the rest accrues after 90 days.</li>
</ul></dd>

<dt>What happens if my campaign reaches its funding goal before its deadline?  Can campaigns raise more money than their goal?</dt>

<dd>Campaigns are scheduled to close at midnight Eastern (US) time of the day when they hit their funding threshold.  They may continue to accrue pledges/sales up to that time, including funding past their goal.</dd>

<dt>What happens if my Pledge Campaign doesn't reach its funding goal by its deadline?</dt>

<dd>The campaign ends.  Supporters' credit cards are not charged, so you are not paid and not obligated to release an unglued ebook.<br /><br />
If you're concerned a campaign may not reach its goal you have several options.  You can lower the target price to a level more likely to succeed.  Or you are welcome to run a second campaign at a later time, perhaps with a different goal, duration, and publicity strategy.  We'd be happy to consult with you about this.</dd>

<dt>What happens if my Buy-to-Unglue Campaign doesn't reach its revenue goal by its termination?</dt>

<dd>Every sale moves a books ungluing date towards the present, and the ungluing date achieved survives the termination of your Buy-to-Unglue Campaign.</dd>

<dt>Is there a minimum funding goal?</dt>

<dd>Yes, the minimum funding goal is $500.</dd>

<dt>What fees does Unglue.it charge in a Fundraising Campaign?</dt>

<dd>Fees and terms for each type of campaign are detailed on the <a href="{% url 'programs'%}">program terms page</a>.</dd>

<dt>Does it cost money to start a campaign on Unglue.it?</dt>

<dd>No.</dd>

<dt>Will I receive a 1099-K tax form?</dt>

<dd>Yes, Unglue.it will issue you one as required by law.</dd>

<h4>Rights</h4>
<dl>
<dt>If I am an author with my book still in print, can I still start a campaign to unglue it?</dt>

<dd>This depends entirely on your original contract with your publisher. You should seek independent advice about your royalty clauses and the "Subsidiary Rights" clauses of your contract. The Authors' Guild provides guidance for its members.</dd>

<dt>If I am an author do I have to talk to my publisher or agent first?</dt>

<dd>It is your responsibility to get advice on the current status of any contracts you may have ever had for the right to publish your work, whether or not a book is in print now. <a href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> licenses are media neutral and worldwide (English). You may need waivers from other parties who have exclusive licenses for this book.</dd>

<dt>If I am a publisher, but I do not have an ebook royalty in my contract, can I sign your Rights Holder Agreement?</dt>

<dd>We can't interpret your particular contract regarding subsidiary rights and your ability to use a Creative Commons license.  Please seek qualified independent advice regarding the terms of your contract.  In any event, you will also want the author to cooperate with you on a successful fundraising campaign, and you can work together to meet the warranties of the RHA.</dd>

<dt>Are the copyright holder, and the rights holder who is eligible to start an Unglue.it campaign, the same person?</dt>

<dd>Not necessarily. If you are the author and copyright holder but have a contract with a publisher, the publisher may be the authorized Rights Holder with respect to commercial rights, and they may be able to sign a licensing agreement on your behalf. Again, you must get advice about your individual contract, especially subsidiary rights clauses and exclusivity.</dd>

<dt>Can I offer a book to be unglued even if I cannot include all the illustrations from the print edition?</dt>

<dd>Yes. If permission to reprint cannot not be obtained for items such as photographs, drawings, color plates, as well as quotations from lyrics and poetry, we can produce an unglued edition which leaves them out.  You must indicate the difference between the editions on your Campaign page.</dd>

<dt>What impact does ungluing a book have on the rights status of my other editions?</dt>

<dd>The Creative Commons licenses are non-exclusive.  They will apply only to the unglued edition, not to the print, audio, or any other editions. They does not affect the rights status of those other editions. If you use the no-derivative, noncommercial license (CC BY-NC-ND), no one else may sell your book or make derivatives unless you give them permission to do so.</dd>

<dt>Can an unglued ebook be issued only in the US?</dt>

<dd>No. An unglued ebook is released to the world. It uses a <a href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license which is territory-neutral. That is, the unglued ebook can be read by anyone, anywhere in the world, subject always to the limitations of the license.</dd>
