                            Your purchased books will be always available for download from your <a href="{% url 'supporter' request.user %}"> personal unglue.it page</a>. You can read the ebooks on any laptop, ebook reader or tablet.

                            An email will be sent to the gift recipient with a redemption link. The recipient clicks on the link, and they're logged into unglue.it, where they can download their ebook, in whatever format they prefer. The ebook has your gift message embedded. In case they've already purchased the ebook from Unglue.it, a recipient can re-gift it. You'll also be sent an email with the redemption link, just in case the email gets lost. It's also in your <a href="/notification">notifications</a>. You can send the redemption link in other ways, if you prefer. When the recipient redeems the link, we'll send you another notification.

                            You can use any format that's available for your purchased book- you don't have to select at time of purchase. The available formats are EPUB and MOBI, so you can read them on a Kindle, an iPad, a Nook, Kobo, iPhone, Mac, PC, Linux or Android device.

                            NO. However, each purchased book you download from unglue.it is personalized with your unglue.it username and your personal license certificate. You should not make copies of personal ebooks for your friends; if you do so, your license may be revoked and the rightsholders may get mad at you. To share ebooks, check out Unglue.it library licenses!

                            <span class="menu level2 answer">
                            If your library participates in Unglue.it, you can pay for a library license instead of purchasing an individual license. The ebook is yours for the first loan period, but the license belongs to your library so other library users can use it after your loan period is up. Obviously, it costs more because more people benefit, but you get the benefit of being part of a community sharing library assets.

                            You need to join a library participating in Unglue.it. If your library is not on <a href="{% url 'library_list' %}">this list</a>, contact your librarian and have them check out our <a href="{% url 'libraries' %}">libraries FAQ</a>.
