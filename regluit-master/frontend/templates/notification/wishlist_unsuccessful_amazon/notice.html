	Amazon has shut off payment processing for new crowdfunding companies.  Therefore the campaign to unglue <a href="{% url 'work' campaign.work_id %}">{{ campaign.work.title }}</a> has been closed.

{% block comments_textual %}
	Because we cannot process payments at this time, we have closed our active campaigns.  If you have pledged to this campaign, your pledge will expire shortly and your credit card will not be charged, nor will you receive any premiums.
	
	Still want to give {{ campaign.work.title }} to the world?  Don't despair.  Keep it on your faves and tell everyone why you love this book.  Encourage your friends to sign up for Unglue.it and add it to their wishlists.  We are hard at work on payment alternatives and intend to reopen campaigns as soon as possible.  With your help, we may yet be able to unglue {{ campaign.work.title }}.
