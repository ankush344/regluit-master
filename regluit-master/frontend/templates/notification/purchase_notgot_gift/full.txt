After more than 7 days, the gift you sent to {{ gift.to }} has not yet been redeemed.

There are several possible reasons for this. 
-  The email address ({{ gift.acq.user.email }}) may have been incorrect.
-  The recipient may have ignored the email with the information about the ebook.
-  The email may have been filtered.
-  The recipient might be on vacation. We'll check again in another week.

Here's the URL that the recipient (and ONLY the recipient) should use to collect the book: 
https://{{ current_site.domain }}{% url 'receive_gift' gift.acq.nonce %}

You can send the link yourself to make sure that it gets to the right place.

You can also "regift" the ebook to a different email address. To do so, FIRST log in to the {{ gift.giver }} account on Unglue.it, and then click on 
https://{{ current_site.domain }}{% url 'receive_gift' gift.acq.nonce %}
