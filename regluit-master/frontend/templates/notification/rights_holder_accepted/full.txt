The Rights Holder Agreement, reproduced in plain text below, for {{ rights_holder.rights_holder_name }} has been accepted and is now an official Unglue.it rights holder.

Here's what to do next:  Find on Unglue.it.  On the More... tab of the book page, you'll now see an option to claim the book. Once you've claimed the book, you can edit its metadata.

If you can't find your books Unglue.it,  that's okay.  You can add your books to Unglue.it directly - use this link: https://unglue.it{% url 'rightsholders' %}#add_your_books
